# Space Invaders

A small clone/sample of a Space Invaders-type game using Pygame.

At the moment I am having a bit of trouble creating a distributable build out of the game so for the time being, install the game like this.

- Install Python from https://www.python.org. The game will run in either Python 2 or 3. But I have developed it against Python 3.
- Install Pygame from http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml for your version of Python.
- Download the zip or clone the repo and run the setup.py script. `python setup.py install`.
- Run the game using `python -m spaceinvaders` or `python -m spaceinvaders -f` for fullscreen.
